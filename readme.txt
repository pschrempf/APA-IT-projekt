This plugin lets you annotate your posts using the Austrian Press Agency annotation service.

== Description ==

This annotation service uses the Austria Press Agency (APA)'s Power Search to deliver you possible annotations.
You will be presented with these results and will have the possibility to select suitable annotations to be saved.
These annotations can then be shown on your website on their own landing pages.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin. 
2. Place the plugin folder into the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation. 
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress. 
4. Various pages have now been added to your site - please do not edit the slug of the 'Annotations' page but feel free to change the title and add it to your menu.
5. Please go to the settings menu to set up the plugin. 
6. Make sure the WYSISWG editor is activated in your user settings. 
7. If the links on the plugin pages do not work properly, please set the 'Permalink' setting to 'Month and name'. 
8. To make the plugin fit a custom theme you may have to edit the 'annotations-template.php' and 'annotations.css' files.
